# Poker Game Repository README

This repository contains Python code for a simple text-based poker game. The game simulates the drawing of cards, the formation of hands, and determines the winner based on standard poker rules. It includes classes for `Card`, `Deck`, and `Hand` objects, along with the main game logic to play a specified number of hands.

## Features

- **Card Class**: Represents individual playing cards with ranks and suits.
- **Deck Class**: Manages a deck of cards, including shuffling and drawing cards.
- **Hand Class**: Represents a player's hand, calculates scores according to poker rules, and supports discarding cards.
- **Game Logic**: Allows users to specify the number of hands they wish to play, displays each hand and its score, and determines the winning hand.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory containing the cloned repository.
4. Run the script using Python by executing `python <filename>.py`, replacing `<filename>` with the name of the file containing the code.

## Usage

Upon running the script, you will be prompted to enter the number of hands you wish to play. After entering a number, the game will simulate the drawing of cards for each hand, calculate the score for each hand according to poker rules, and determine the winning hand.
